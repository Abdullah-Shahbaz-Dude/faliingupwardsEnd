# ðŸš€ FINAL WEBSITE OPTIMIZATION PLAN

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: 2 URGENT FIXES NEEDED

### **Priority 1: Compress 25MB Hero Image (CRITICAL)**
```bash
File: src/assets/home/hero/IMG_7553.webp (25MB)
Status: BREAKING YOUR WEBSITE!
Impact: 60+ second load time, mobile browsers crash
```

**IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
1. Go to https://squoosh.app or https://tinypng.com
2. Upload `IMG_7553.webp`
3. Compress to under 500KB (50x smaller)
4. Replace the existing file

**Expected Result:** Homepage loads in 3 seconds instead of 60+ seconds!

### **Priority 2: Convert 6 Large PNG Files**
```bash
These PNG files are still 2.7MB each:
- src/assets/ourServices/executive-mentoring/what-we-offer/image-2.png (2.7MB)
- src/assets/ourServices/executive-mentoring/what-we-offer/image-3.png (2.1MB)
- src/assets/ourServices/executive-mentoring/our-approch/image-2.png (2.7MB)
- src/assets/ourServices/executive-mentoring/our-approch/image-3.png (2.1MB)
- src/assets/ourServices/executive-mentoring/our-approch/image-5.png (2.7MB)
- src/assets/ourServices/digital-evolution/real-estate-agents.png (940KB)
```

**ACTION:**
1. Convert each PNG to WebP (same names, .webp extension)
2. Expected size: 200KB each (90% smaller)
